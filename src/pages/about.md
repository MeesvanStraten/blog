Hi there, my name is Mees.

I am a developer who is passionate about DevOps, cloud-native development, and back-end development in general. Currently, I work for CloudLegends (by Kabisa) as a DevOps/Cloud Engineer. I have experience and enjoy working with Azure and AWS. Currently I am studying to get certified as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.

When I learn new skills or technologies I will share them here on this blog, hoping it will be of help to someone.

***TLDR;***
I like building stuff and enjoy the following tech stack frequently:
## Cloud ☁️
- AWS
- Azure

 Google cloud less often, but is also interesting to work with.

 ## Languages & frameworks
 - C#, .Net Core & Entity Framework
 - Java, Spring & Quarkus
 - Golang


 ## Databases
 - PostgreSQL
 - MSSQL
 - MongoDB
 - Cloud Firestore

 ## Other cool stuff
 - Terraform
 - Datadog
 - Kubernetes
