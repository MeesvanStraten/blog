Hi there, my name is Mees.

I am a developer who is passionate about DevOps, cloud-native development, and back-end development in general. Currently, I am graduating from Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I have experience and enjoy working with Azure and AWS public clouds, soon I would like to get certified for these public clouds.

When I learn new skills or technologies I will share them here on this blog, hoping it will be of help to someone.

***TLDR;***
I like building stuff and enjoy the following tech stack frequently:
## Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
- AWS
- Azure

 Google cloud less often, but is also interesting to work with.

 ## Languages & frameworks
 - C#, .Net Core & Entity Framework
 - Java, Spring & Quarkus
 - Golang
 - Dart & Flutter üê¶

 ## Databases
 - PostgreSQL
 - MSSQL
 - MongoDB
